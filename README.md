# BashPass
CLI based password manager

I tried to make a secure password manager in bash. Using different types of permissions, encryption and compression.
I also left some examples in query directory for users to check before installing.

NOTE: When installed, program won't work if runned by user, you must be root in order to start it.

More updates on security will be done soon.
